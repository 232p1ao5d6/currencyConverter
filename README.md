# currencyConverter
Currency Converter Project (Java)
Built a Java-based Currency Converter that converts amounts between multiple currencies using predefined exchange rates. Implemented a clean menu-driven interface, efficient data handling with HashMap, and accurate calculations. A great project to strengthen Java basics, logic building, and real-world application skills. 🚀
